+
+When kptr_restrict is set to (1), kernel pointers printed using the %pK
+format specifier will be replaced with 0's unless the user has CAP_SYSLOG
+and effective user and group ids are equal to the real ids. This is
+because %pK checks are done at read() time rather than open() time, so
+if permissions are elevated between the open() and the read() (e.g via
+a setuid binary) then %pK will not leak kernel pointers to unprivileged
+users. Note, this is a temporary solution only. The correct long-term
+solution is to do the permission checks at open() time. Consider removing
+world read permissions from files that use %pK, and using dmesg_restrict
+to protect against uses of %pK in dmesg(8) if leaking kernel pointer
+values to unprivileged users is a concern.
+
+When kptr_restrict is set to (2), kernel pointers printed using
+%pK will be replaced with 0's regardless of privileges.

+perf_cpu_time_max_percent:
+
+Hints to the kernel how much CPU time it should be allowed to
+use to handle perf sampling events.  If the perf subsystem
+is informed that its samples are exceeding this limit, it
+will drop its sampling frequency to attempt to reduce its CPU
+usage.
+
+Some perf sampling happens in NMIs.  If these samples
+unexpectedly take too long to execute, the NMIs can become
+stacked up next to each other so much that nothing else is
+allowed to execute.
+
+0: disable the mechanism.  Do not monitor or correct perf's
+   sampling rate no matter how CPU time it takes.
+
+1-100: attempt to throttle perf's sample rate to this
+   percentage of CPU.  Note: the kernel calculates an
+   "expected" length of each sample event.  100 here means
+   100% of that expected length.  Even if this is set to
+   100, you may still see sample throttling if this
+   length is exceeded.  Set to 0 if you truly do not care
+   how much CPU is consumed.
