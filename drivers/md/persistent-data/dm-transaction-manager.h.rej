 /*
  * We use a 2-phase commit here.
  *
- * i) In the first phase the block manager is told to start flushing, and
- * the changes to the space map are written to disk.  You should interrogate
- * your particular space map to get detail of its root node etc. to be
- * included in your superblock.
+ * i) Make all changes for the transaction *except* for the superblock.
+ * Then call dm_tm_pre_commit() to flush them to disk.
  *
- * ii) @root will be committed last.  You shouldn't use more than the
- * first 512 bytes of @root if you wish the transaction to survive a power
- * failure.  You *must* have a write lock held on @root for both stage (i)
- * and (ii).  The commit will drop the write lock.
+ * ii) Lock your superblock.  Update.  Then call dm_tm_commit() which will
+ * unlock the superblock and flush it.  No other blocks should be updated
+ * during this period.  Care should be taken to never unlock a partially
+ * updated superblock; perform any operations that could fail *before* you
+ * take the superblock lock.
