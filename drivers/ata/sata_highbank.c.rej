+ * The Calxeda SATA phy intermittently fails to bring up a link with Gen3
+ * Retrying the phy hard reset can work around the issue, but the drive
+ * may fail again. In less than 150 out of 15000 test runs, it took more
+ * than 10 tries for the link to be established (but never more than 35).
+ * Triple the maximum observed retry count to provide plenty of margin for
+ * rare events and to guarantee that the link is established.
+ *
+ * Also, the default 2 second time-out on a failed drive is too long in
+ * this situation. The uboot implementation of the same driver function
+ * uses a much shorter time-out period and never experiences a time out
+ * issue. Reducing the time-out to 500ms improves the responsiveness.
+ * The other timing constants were kept the same as the stock AHCI driver.
+ * This change was also tested 15000 times on 24 drives and none of them
+ * experienced a time out.
